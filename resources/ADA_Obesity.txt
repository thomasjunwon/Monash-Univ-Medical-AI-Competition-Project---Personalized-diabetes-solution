# 8. Obesity and Weight Management


## Approved Weight Management Pharmacotherapy


#### ​


## Summarize


#### ​


#### The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several medications for weight management as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie eating pattern and increased physical activity in individuals with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with one or more obesity-associated comorbid conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia). Nearly all FDA-approved weight management medications have been shown to improve glycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and delay progression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals (22), and some of these agents (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management.


#### Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment (88), while all others are approved for long-term treatment (22) (Tables 8.1 and 8.2 ). (Refer to Section 14, “Children and Adolescents,” for medications approved for adolescents with obesity.) In addition, setmelanotide, a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, is approved for use in cases of rare genetic mutations resulting in severe hyperphagia and extreme obesity, such as leptin receptor deficiency and proopiomelanocortin deficiency.

#### In people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects are preferred (refer to Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches to Diabetes Treatment”) and include agents from the GLP-1 RA class and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA class (collectively referred to as nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics, a class that also includes other investigational agents that act on various nutrient-stimulated hormonal pathways, like glucagon and amylin). Should use of these medications not result in achievement of weight management goals, or if they are not tolerated or are contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be considered.


#### In the Effect and Safety of Semaglutide 2.4 mg Once-Weekly in Subjects With Overweight or Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (STEP 2) trial, semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in a body weight loss of 6.2% more than placebo and A1C lowering of 1.2% more than placebo after 68 weeks (50). In the Efficacy and Safety of Tirzepatide Once Weekly in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Who Have Obesity or Are Overweight: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial (SURMOUNT-2), tirzepatide resulted in body weight loss of 9.6% and 11.6% more than placebo and A1C lowering of 1.55% and 1.57% more than placebo after 72 weeks of treatment with the 10 mg and 15 mg doses, respectively, with adverse effects similar to those seen with the GLP-1 RA class (89).


#### The observed weight loss with weight management pharmacotherapy is lower in people with diabetes than in those of similar baseline weight without diabetes; therefore, it is important to appropriately manage expectations of individuals with diabetes and health care professionals.


#### Weight management pharmacotherapy has demonstrated multiple additional benefits beyond weight loss and improvement in glucose management. Some such examples include improvements or potential improvements in cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and lipids), inflammation, obstructive sleep apnea, MASLD and MASH, and symptoms related to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (90–93). Liraglutide 1.8 mg and semaglutide 1 mg (doses approved for type 2 diabetes, which are lower than those approved for the treatment of obesity) demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes who are either at high risk for cardiovascular disease or have cardiovascular disease (51,94).


#### Additionally, semaglutide 2.4 mg (dose approved for the treatment of obesity) also demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events in people with overweight or obesity and preexistent cardiovascular disease but without diabetes (95).


#### Health care professionals should be knowledgeable about the dosing, benefits, and risks for each treatment option to balance the potential benefits of successful weight loss against the potential risks for each individual. The high risk and prevalence of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes must be balanced against the lack of long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial data for agents like combination naltrexone and bupropion and combination phentermine and topiramate. The response to all weight management medications is highly heterogeneous; therefore, their weight loss effectiveness should be reevaluated after initiation and therapy adjustments should be considered, if needed.


#### All these medications are contraindicated in individuals who are pregnant or actively trying to conceive and are not recommended for use in individuals who are nursing. Individuals of childbearing potential should receive counseling regarding the use of reliable methods of contraception while using weight loss medications. Tirzepatide in particular may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives due to delayed gastric emptying, an effect that is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time. Individuals using oral hormonal contraceptives should switch to a nonoral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation.


#### Of note, while weight loss medications are often used in people with type 1 diabetes, clinical trial data in this population are limited.


#### Incretin pharmacotherapies and metabolic surgery options for weight loss may increase the risk for malnutrition and sarcopenia (96). Health care professionals should encourage resistance training (97) and sufficient protein intake. Individuals with diabetes who are experiencing significant (>20%) or rapid (>4 kg/month) weight loss should be screened for malnutrition. While no single method is best to screen for both malnutrition and sarcopenia, instruments are available to screen for each condition, including the Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) (98–100).


#### For a more detailed discussion of malnutrition in the context of diabetes and weight loss, see Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes.”


#### Thus, choice of therapy should be guided by person-centered treatment factors, including comorbidities, considerations of adverse effects and treatment burden, treatment cost and accessibility, and the individual’s therapeutic goals and preferences. Medication cost and insurance coverage considerations often influence treatment decisions, and payors should cover evidence-based obesity treatments for people with diabetes and prediabetes to reduce barriers to treatment access.


#### It is also essential that health care teams are knowledgeable about insurance coverage requirements and establish systems to support clinicians in prescribing evidence-based weight management medications and to reduce financial hardship of treatment for individuals, including formulary and medication coverage requirements, eligibility for medication assistance programs, and availability of copayment reduction cards (see Section 1, “Improving Care and Promoting Health in Populations”).


### 8.21 Consider metabolic surgery as a weight and glycemic management approach in people with diabetes with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 (or ≥27.5 kg/m2 in Asian American individuals) who are otherwise good surgical candidates. A


### 8.22 Metabolic surgery should be performed in high-volume centers with interprofessional teams knowledgeable about and experienced in managing obesity, diabetes, and gastrointestinal surgery (www.facs.org/quality-programs/accreditation-and-verification/metabolic-and-bariatric-surgery-accreditation-and-quality-improvement-program/). E


### 8.23 People being considered for metabolic surgery should be evaluated for comorbid psychological conditions and social and situational circumstances that have the potential to interfere with surgery outcomes. B


### 8.24 People who undergo metabolic surgery should receive long-term medical and behavioral support and routine micronutrient, nutritional, and metabolic status monitoring. B


### 8.25 If post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia is suspected, clinical evaluation should exclude other potential disorders contributing to hypoglycemia, and management should include education, medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia, and medication treatment, as needed. A In individuals with post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia, use continuous glucose monitoring to improve safety. C


### 8.26 In people who undergo metabolic surgery, routinely screen for psychosocial and behavioral health changes and refer to a qualified behavioral health professional as needed. C


### 8.27 Monitor individuals who have undergone metabolic surgery for insufficient weight loss or weight recurrence at least every 6–12 months. E In those who have insufficient weight loss or experience weight recurrence, assess for potential predisposing factors and, if appropriate, consider additional weight loss interventions (e.g., weight management pharmacotherapy). C


#### Surgical procedures for obesity treatment—often referred to interchangeably as bariatric surgery, weight loss surgery, metabolic surgery, or metabolic/bariatric surgery—can promote significant and durable weight loss and improve glycemic management and long-term outcomes in those with type 2 diabetes. Given the magnitude and rapidity of improvement of hyperglycemia and glucose homeostasis, these procedures have been suggested as treatments for type 2 diabetes even in the absence of severe obesity, hence the current preferred terminology of “metabolic surgery” (108).


#### A substantial body of evidence, including data from large cohort studies and randomized controlled (nonblinded) clinical trials, demonstrates that metabolic surgery achieves superior glycemic management and reduction of cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity compared with nonsurgical intervention (47). In addition to improving glycemia, metabolic surgery reduces the incidence of microvascular disease (109), improves quality of life (47,110,111), decreases cancer risk, improves cardiovascular disease risk factors and long-term cardiovascular events (111–119), and decreases all-cause mortality (120). Cohort studies that match surgical and nonsurgical subjects strongly suggest that metabolic surgery reduces all-cause mortality (121,122).


#### Studies have also shown that metabolic surgery can improve liver outcomes among individuals with MASH, including biopsy-proven disease (123–125).


#### The overwhelming majority of procedures performed in the U.S. are vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Both procedures result in a smaller stomach pouch and often robust changes in enteroendocrine hormones. In VSG, ∼80% of the stomach is removed, leaving behind a long, thin sleeve-shaped pouch. RYGB creates a much smaller stomach pouch (roughly the size of a walnut), which is then attached to the distal small intestine, thereby bypassing the duodenum and jejunum.


#### Metabolic surgery has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes irrespective of the presurgical BMI (126). The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery recommends metabolic surgery for people with type 2 diabetes and a BMI ≥30 kg/m2(or ≥27.5 kg/m2 for Asian American individuals) in surgically eligible individuals. A real-world data analysis through the National Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) in the U.S. compared surgical outcomes between 6,233 individuals with type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB and 3,477 who underwent VSG. At 1 year after surgery, those who had RYGB lost on average 29.1% of their total body weight, while those who had VSG lost on average 22.8% of their total body weight.


#### At 5 years after surgery, the total body weight loss was 24.1% for those who had RYGB and 16.1% for those who had VSG, with 86.1% of individuals experiencing type 2 diabetes remission after RYGB and 83.5% of individuals experiencing type 2 diabetes remission after VSG. Among the 6,141 individuals who experienced type 2 diabetes remission, the subsequent type 2 diabetes relapse rate was lower for those who had RYGB than for those who had VSG (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.67–0.84]). Estimated relapse rates for those who had RYGB and VSG were 33.1% and 41.6%, respectively, at 5 years after surgery. At 5 years, compared with baseline, A1C was reduced, on average, 0.4 percentage points more for individuals who had RYGB than for individuals who had VSG (127).


#### Most notably, the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial, which randomized 150 participants with type 2 diabetes, A1C >7.0%, and BMI 27–43 kg/m2 to receive either metabolic surgery or medical treatment for type 2 diabetes using glucose-lowering agents, found that 29% of those treated with RYGB and 23% of those treated with VSG achieved A1C of ≤6.0% after 5 years (47). Available data suggest an erosion of diabetes remission over time (48); 35–50% of individuals who initially achieve remission of diabetes eventually experience recurrence.


#### Still, the median disease-free period among such individuals following RYGB is 8.3 years (128,129), and the majority of those who undergo surgery maintain substantial improvement of glycemia from baseline for at least 5–15 years (47,110,111,113).


#### Exceedingly few presurgical predictors of diabetes remission have been identified. However, younger age, shorter duration of diabetes (e.g., <8 years) (101), and lesser severity of diabetes (better glycemic management, not using insulin) are associated with higher rates of diabetes remission (47,111,130,131). Greater baseline visceral fat area may also predict diabetes remission, especially among Asian American people with type 2 diabetes (132).


#### A review of case series and reports suggests that metabolic surgery also improves the metabolic profiles and cardiovascular risk of people with type 1 diabetes, but larger and longer-term studies with better designs are needed to determine the role of metabolic surgery in such individuals (133).


#### Whereas metabolic surgery has greater initial costs than nonsurgical obesity treatments, retrospective analyses and modeling studies suggest that surgery may be cost-effective or even cost-saving for individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, these results largely depend on assumptions about the long-term effectiveness and safety of the procedures, the specific medications being compared, the time horizon for cost-effectiveness assessments, and the population examined (e.g., duration and severity of diabetes) (134,135).


#### The safety of metabolic surgery has improved significantly with continued refinement of minimally invasive (laparoscopic) approaches, enhanced training and credentialing, and involvement of interprofessional teams. Perioperative mortality rates are typically 0.1–0.5%, similar to those for common abdominal procedures such as cholecystectomy and hysterectomy (136,137). Major complications occur in 2–6% of those undergoing metabolic surgery, which compares favorably with the rates for other commonly performed elective operations (137). Postsurgical recovery times and morbidity have also dramatically declined. Minor complications and need for operative reintervention occur in up to 15% (136,138–143).


#### Empirical data suggest that the proficiency of the operating surgeon and surgical team is a key determinant of mortality, complications, reoperations, and readmissions (144). Accordingly, metabolic surgery should be performed in high-volume centers with interprofessional teams experienced in managing diabetes, obesity, and gastrointestinal surgery. Refer to the American College of Surgeons website for information on accreditation and locations of accredited programs (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/accreditation-and-verification/metabolic-and-bariatric-surgery-accreditation-and-quality-improvement-program/).


#### Beyond the perioperative period, longer-term risks include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, anemia, osteoporosis, dumping syndrome, and severe hypoglycemia (145). Nutritional and micronutrient deficiencies and related complications occur with variable frequency depending on the type of surgical procedure and require routine monitoring of micronutrient and nutritional status and lifelong vitamin/nutritional supplementation (145). Dumping syndrome usually occurs shortly (10–30 min) after a meal and may present with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and fatigue; hypoglycemia is usually not present at the time of symptoms but, in some cases, may develop several hours later.


#### Post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia can occur with RYGB, VSG, and other gastrointestinal procedures and may severely impact quality of life (146–148). Post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia is driven in part by altered gastric emptying of ingested nutrients, leading to rapid intestinal glucose absorption and excessive postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and other gastrointestinal peptides. As a result, overstimulation of insulin release and a sharp drop in plasma glucose occur, most commonly 1–3 h after a high-carbohydrate meal. Symptoms range from sweating, tremor, tachycardia, and increased hunger to impaired cognition, loss of consciousness, and seizures.


#### In contrast to dumping syndrome, which often occurs soon after surgery and improves over time, post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia typically presents >1 year after surgery. Diagnosis is primarily made by a thorough examination of history, detailed records of food intake, physical activity, and symptom patterns, and exclusion of other potential causes of hypoglycemia (e.g., malnutrition, side effects of medications or supplements, dumping syndrome, and insulinoma). Initial management includes education to facilitate reduced intake of rapidly digested carbohydrates while ensuring adequate intake of protein, healthy fats, and vitamin and nutrient supplements.


#### When available, individuals should be offered medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia and the use of continuous glucose monitoring (ideally real-time continuous glucose monitoring, which can detect dropping glucose levels before severe hypoglycemia occurs), especially for those with impaired hypoglycemia awareness. Medication treatment, if needed, is primarily aimed at slowing carbohydrate absorption (e.g., acarbose) or reducing GLP-1 and insulin secretion (e.g., diazoxide, octreotide) (149).


#### People who undergo metabolic surgery may be at increased risk for substance use, worsening or new-onset depression and/or anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation (150–154). Candidates for metabolic surgery should be assessed by a behavioral health professional with expertise in obesity management prior to consideration for surgery (155). Surgery should be postponed in individuals with alcohol or substance use disorders, severe depression, suicidal ideation, or other significant behavioral health conditions until these conditions have been sufficiently addressed. Individuals with preoperative or new-onset psychopathology should be assessed regularly following surgery to optimize behavioral health and postsurgical outcomes.


#### Finally, no definitive evidence supports the pre– and post–metabolic surgery use of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics for chronic obesity. Existing studies suggest that among individuals with a BMI >50 kg/m2, GLP-1 RAs are associated with significant weight loss prior to surgery with no increase in complications or time to surgery (156). Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics can be considered as adjuvants after metabolic surgery to augment initial weight loss either shortly after surgery or when weight loss has plateaued (157). Studies have also shown that GLP-1 RAs can effectively treat weight regain after metabolic surgery and therefore could be considered as an alternative to revisional surgery (158).


#### Long-term outcomes, however, are lacking in terms of durability of weight loss, effect on weight regain when medications are stopped, and long-term side effects with use and after discontinuation (159).
